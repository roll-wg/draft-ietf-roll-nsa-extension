        Packet Replication and Elimination is a method in which several copies of a data packet are sent in the network in order to achieve high reliability and low jitter.
        This document details how to apply Packet Replication and Elimination in RPL, especially how to exchange information within RPL control packets to let a node better select the different parents that will be used to forward the multiple copies of a packet.
        This document also describes the Objective Function which takes advantage of this information to implement multi-path routing.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        Networks in the industrial context must provide stringent guarantees in terms of reliability and predictability, with this domain being one of the main ones addressed by <xref target="RFC8557">Deterministic Networking</xref>.
        Packet Replication and Elimination (PRE) (<xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture" sectionFormat="of" section="4.5.3"/>) is a technique which allows redundant paths in the network to be utilized for traffic requiring higher reliability.
        
        Allowing industrial applications to function over wireless networks requires the application of the principles and <xref target="RFC8655">architecture of Deterministic Networking</xref>.
        This results in designs that aim at optimizing packet delivery rate and bounding latency.

        Additionally, nodes operating on battery need to minimize their energy consumption.
      </t>
      <t>  
        As an example, to meet this goal, <xref target="IEEE802154">IEEE Std. 802.15.4</xref> provides Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), a mode of operation that uses a common communication schedule
based on timeslots to allow deterministic medium access as well as channel hopping to work around radio interference.
        However, since TSCH uses retransmissions in the event of a failed transmission, end-to-end latency and jitter performance can deteriorate.
      </t>
      <t>
        Furthermore, the 6TiSCH working group, focusing on IPv6 over IEEE Std. 802.15.4-TSCH, has worked on these issues and produced the <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture">"6TiSCH Architecture"</xref> to address that case.
      </t>
      <t>
        PRE is a general method of maximizing packet delivery rate and potentially minimizing latency and jitter, not limited to 6TiSCH.
        More specifically, PRE achieves controlled redundancy by laying multiple forwarding paths through the network and using them in parallel for different copies of the same packet.
        
        PRE can follow the Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) formed by <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref> from a node to the root. 
        Building a multi-path DODAG can be achieved based on the RPL capability of having multiple parents for each node in a network, a subset of which is used to forward packets.
        In order to select parents to be part of this subset, the RPL Objective Function (OF) needs additional information regarding the multi-path nature of PRE.

        This document describes an OF which implements multi-path routing for PRE and specifies the transmission of this specific path information.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document describes a new Objective Function (OF) called the Common Ancestor (CA) OF (see <xref target="ca_of" />).
        A detailed description is given of how the path information is used within the CA OF and how the subset of parents for forwarding packets is selected.
        This specification defines a new Objective Code Point (OCP) for the CA OF.
      </t>
      <t>

        For the path information, this specification focuses on the extensions to the <xref target="RFC6551">DAG Metric Container</xref> required for supplying to the PRE mechanism a part of the information it needs to operate.
        This information is the <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref> parent address set of a node and it must be sent to potential children of the node.
        The RPL DIO Control Message is the canonical way of broadcasting this kind of information and therefore its <xref target="RFC6551">DAG Metric Container</xref> field is used to append a Node State and Attribute (NSA) object.
        The node's parent address set is stored as an optional TLV within the NSA object.
        This specification defines the type value and structure for the parent address set TLV (see <xref target="PS_TLV" />).

      <name>Common Ancestor AP Selection Policies</name>
      <t>
        In the RPL protocol, each node maintains a list of potential parents. 
        For PRE, the Preferred Parent (PP) node is defined to be the same as the RPL DODAG Preferred Parent node. 
        Furthermore, to construct an alternative path toward the root, in addition to the PP node, each node in the network selects some additional parent(s), called alternative parent(s), from its Parent Set (PS).
      </t>
      <t>
        There are multiple possible policies for selecting the AP node.
        This section details three such possible policies.
      </t>
      <t>
        All three policies defined perform AP selection based on common ancestors, named Common Ancestor Strict, Common Ancestor Medium, and Common Ancestor Relaxed, depending on how restrictive the selection process is.
        A more restrictive policy will limit flooding but might fail to select an appropriate AP, while a less restrictive one will more often find an appropriate AP but might increase flooding.
      </t>
      <t>
        All three policies apply their corresponding common ancestor criterion to filter the list of candidate neighbors in the alternative parent set.

        An OF which allows the multiple paths to remain correlated is detailed here.
        More specifically, when using this OF a node will select an AP node close to its PP node to allow the operation of overhearing between parents.
        For more details about overhearing and its use in this context see the "Complex Track with Replication and Elimination" in <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture" sectionFormat="of" section="4.5.3"/>.
        If multiple potential APs match this condition, the AP with the lowest rank will be registered.
      </t>
      <t>
        The OF described here is an extension of <xref target="RFC6719">The Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function</xref>.
        In general, this OF extends MRHOF by specifying how an AP is selected.
        Importantly, the calculation of the rank of the node through each candidate neighbor and the selection of the PP is kept the same as in MRHOF.

        How the CA OF modifies MRHOF in a section-by-section manner follows in detail:

        <dd>
                The CA OF uses only one metric, like MRHOF, for rank calculation, with the same MRHOF semantics.
                For selecting the AP, the PS TLV (stored in the DIO Metric Container Node State and Attribute (NSA) object body, see <xref target="PS_TLV"/>) is used.
                This additional NSA metric is disregarded for rank calculation.

        <dd>
                Same as MRHOF extended to AP selection.
                Minimum Rank path selection and switching apply correspondingly to the AP with the extra CA requirement of having some match between ancestors.

            The AP is then selected from the alternative parent set based on Rank and using hysteresis as is done for the PP in MRHOF.

            Different nodes may use different AP selection policies since the selection policy is local to each node.

            In order to select their AP node, nodes need to be aware of their grandparent node sets. 
            Within <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref>, the nodes use the DODAG Information Object (DIO) Control Message to broadcast information about themselves to potential children.
            However, <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref>, does not define how to propagate information related to the parent set, which is what this document addresses. 
      </t>
      <t>
            DIO messages can carry multiple options, out of which the <xref target="RFC6551">DAG Metric Container option</xref> is the most suitable structurally and semantically to carry the parent set.
            The DAG Metric Container option itself can carry different nested objects, out of which the <xref target="RFC6551">Node State and Attribute (NSA)</xref> is appropriate for transferring generic node state data.
            Within the Node State and Attribute, it is possible to store optional TLVs representing various node characteristics.
            As per the <xref target="RFC6551">Node State and Attribute (NSA)</xref> description, no TLV has been defined for use.
            This document defines one TLV for transmitting a node's parent set.

                    The selection of how many parents from the parent set will be included is left to the implementation.  
                    The number of parent addresses in the PS IPv6 address(es) field can be deduced by dividing the length of the PS IPv6 address(es) field in bytes by 16, the number of bytes in an IPv6 address.

        <t>
            The PS SHOULD be used in the process of parent selection, and especially in AP selection since it can help the alternative path to not significantly deviate from the preferred path.
            The Parent Set is information local to the node that broadcasts it.
        </t>
        <t>
            The PS is used only within NSA objects configured as a metric, therefore the DAG Metric Container field "C" MUST be 0.
            Additionally, since the information in the PS needs to be propagated downstream but cannot be aggregated, the DAG Metric Container field "R" MUST be 1.
            Finally, since the information contained is by definition partial, more specifically just the parent set of the DIO-sending node, the DAG Metric Container field "P" MUST be 1.
        </t>
        <t>    
        It is important to highlight that the PS does not affect the calculation of the rank through candidate neighbors.
            It is only used with the CA OF to remove nodes that do not fulfill the CA OF criteria from the candidate neighbor list.

      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
                A malicious node that can receive and read the DIO can "see" further than its neighborhood by one hop, learning the addresses of its two-hop neighbors.

      <name>Implementation Status</name>
      <t>
        A research-stage implementation of the PRE mechanism using the proposed extension as part of a 6TiSCH IOT use case was developed at IMT Atlantique, France by Tomas Lagos Jenschke and Remous-Aris Koutsiamanis.
        It was implemented on the open-source Contiki OS and tested with the Cooja simulator.
        The DIO DAGMC NSA extension is implemented with a configurable number of parents from the parent set of a node to be reported.

                32 nodes structured in a regular grid as shown in <xref target="fig_sim_topology"/>. 
                Node S (source) is the only data packet sender and sends data to node R (root).
                The parent set of each node (except R) is all the nodes in the immediately higher row, the immediately above 6 nodes.
                For example, each node in {51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56} is connected to all of {41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46}.
                Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 have a single upwards link to R.

      <name>Choosing an AP selection policy</name>
      <t>
        The manner of choosing an AP selection policy is left to the implementation, for maximum flexibility.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a different policy can be used per traffic type.
        The network configurator can choose the CA Relaxed policy to increase reliability (thus producing some flooding) for specific, extremely important, alert packets.
        On the other hand, all normal data traffic uses the CA Strict policy.
        Therefore, an exception is made just for the alert packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        Another option would be to devise a new disjoint policy, where the paths are on purpose non-correlated, to increase path diversity and resilience against whole groups of nodes failing.
        The disadvantage may be increased jitter.
      </t>
      <t>
        Finally, a network configurator may provide the CA policies with a preference order of Strict &gt; Medium &gt; Relaxed as a means of falling back to more flood-prone policies to maintain reliability.
