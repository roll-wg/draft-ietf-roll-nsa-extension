        High reliability and low jitter can be achieved by being able to send data packets through multiple paths, via different parents, in a network.
        This document details how to exchange the necessary information within RPL control packets to let a node better select the different parents that will be used to forward a packet over different paths.
        This document also describes the Objective Function which takes advantage of this information to implement multi-path routing.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
        Networks in the industrial context must provide stringent guarantees in terms of reliability and predictability, with this domain being one of the main ones addressed by <xref target="RFC8557">Deterministic Networking</xref>.
        
        One of the ways of achieving such guarantees is through Packet Replication and Elimination (PRE) (<xref target="RFC9030" sectionFormat="of" section="4.5.3"/>), a technique which allows redundant paths in the network to be utilized for traffic requiring higher reliability.

        Another is to have pre-selected backup paths on standby for quick packet retransmission when packet failures occur.

        Load-balancing can be also used to make sure that not all traffic passes through the same nodes, to more evenly spread the packet forwarding load.
        
        Allowing industrial applications to function over wireless networks requires the application of the principles and <xref target="RFC8655">architecture of Deterministic Networking</xref>.
        This results in designs that aim at optimizing packet delivery rate and bounding latency.

        Additionally, nodes operating on battery need to minimize their energy consumption.
      </t>
      <t>  
        As an example, to meet this goal, <xref target="IEEE802154">IEEE Std. 802.15.4</xref> provides Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), a mode of operation that uses a common communication schedule
based on timeslots to allow deterministic medium access as well as channel hopping to work around radio interference.
        However, since TSCH uses retransmissions in the event of a failed transmission, end-to-end latency and jitter performance can deteriorate.
      </t>
      <t>
        Furthermore, the 6TiSCH working group, focusing on IPv6 over IEEE Std. 802.15.4-TSCH, has worked on these issues and produced the <xref target="RFC9030">"6TiSCH Architecture"</xref> to address that case.
      </t>
      <t>
        Building a multi-path DODAG can be achieved based on the RPL capability of having multiple parents for each node in a network, a subset of which is used to forward packets.
        In order to select parents to be part of this subset, the RPL Objective Function (OF) needs additional information.

        This document describes an OF which implements multi-path routing and specifies the transmission of this specific path information.
      </t>
      <t>
        This document describes a new Objective Function (OF) called the Common Ancestor (CA) OF (see <xref target="ca_of" />).
        A detailed description is given of how the path information is used within the CA OF and how the subset of parents for forwarding packets is selected.
        This specification defines a new Objective Code Point (OCP) for the CA OF.
      </t>
      <t>

        For the path information, this specification focuses on the extensions to the <xref target="RFC6551">DAG Metric Container</xref> required for supplying to the CA OF a part of the information it needs to operate.
        This information is the <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref> parent address set of a node and it must be sent to potential children of the node.
        The RPL DIO Control Message is the canonical way of broadcasting this kind of information and therefore its <xref target="RFC6551">DAG Metric Container</xref> field is used to append a Node State and Attribute (NSA) object.
        The node's parent address set is stored as an optional TLV within the NSA object.
        This specification defines the type value and structure for the parent address set TLV (see <xref target="PS_TLV" />).

      <name>Common Ancestor AP Selection Policies</name>
      <t>
        In the RPL protocol, each node maintains a list of potential parents. 
        When more than one parent is required, as when performing PRE, the RPL DODAG Preferred Parent node is used, as per <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref> parent selection, effectively depending on the OF used.
        If the CA OF is used, the way this choice is made is described in <xref target="ca_of" />.
        Furthermore, to construct an alternative path toward the root, in addition to the PP node, each node in the network selects one or more parents, called Alternative Parents (APs), from its Parent Set (PS).
      </t>
      <t>
        There are multiple possible policies for selecting the AP node.
        This section details three such possible policies.
      </t>
      <t>
        All three policies defined perform AP selection based on common ancestors, named Common Ancestor Strict, Common Ancestor Medium, and Common Ancestor Relaxed, depending on how restrictive the selection process is.
        A more restrictive policy will limit flooding but might fail to select an appropriate AP, while a less restrictive one will more often find an appropriate AP but might increase flooding.
      </t>
      <t>
        All three policies apply their corresponding common ancestor criterion to filter the list of candidate neighbors in the Alternative Parent set.
      </t>
      <t>
        If after the filtering there are multiple condition-meeting candidate nodes, the node MUST select at least one of them as its AP node. 
        The way this choice is made depends on which OF is used. 
        If the CA OF is used, the way this choice is made is described in <xref target="ca_of" />.

            For example, in <xref target="fig_ca_alternative_parent_selection"/>, the source node S must know its grandparent sets through nodes A, B, C, and D.
            The Parent Sets (PS) and the Preferred Parents (PS) of nodes A, B, C, and D are shown on the side of the figure.
            The CA Strict parent selection policy will select an AP for node S for which PP(PP(S)) = PP(AP).

      <name>Common Ancestor Objective Function</name>
      <t>
        An OF which allows the multiple paths to remain correlated is detailed here.
        More specifically, when using this OF a node will select an AP node "close" to its PP node to allow the operation of overhearing between parents.
        Closeness here is not strictly defined, however, the premise is that those candidate parent nodes that have common parents themselves have a higher probability of being within each other's radio range, though it's of course not guaranteed.
        
        For more details about overhearing and its use in this context see the "Complex Track with Replication and Elimination" in <xref target="RFC9030" sectionFormat="of" section="4.5.3"/>.
        If multiple potential APs match this condition, the AP with the lowest rank will be registered.
      </t>
      <t>
        The OF described here is an extension of <xref target="RFC6719">The Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function (MRHOF)</xref>.
        The CA OF does not update <xref target="RFC6719"/>. 
        Rather, it uses the existing definition of MRHOF in <xref target="RFC6719"/> to build a new OF (with a new Objective Code Point (OCP)) which provides additional functionality, while maintaining compatibility by retaining the existing functionality of MRHOF for the preferred parent.

        To be precise, this OF extends MRHOF by specifying how an AP is selected while the selection and switching of the PP remain unaltered.
        Importantly, the calculation of the rank of the node through each candidate neighbor and the selection of the PP is kept the same as in MRHOF.
      </t>
      <t>
        How the CA OF differs from MRHOF in a section-by-section manner follows in detail:
      </t>
      <dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
        <dt><xref target="RFC6719" sectionFormat="comma" section="2" />: "Terminology". Term "Selected Metric":</dt>
        <dd>
                The CA OF uses only one metric, like MRHOF, for rank calculation, with the same MRHOF semantics.
                For selecting the AP, the PS TLV (stored in the DIO Metric Container Node State and Attribute (NSA) object body, see <xref target="PS_TLV"/>) is used.
                This additional NSA metric is disregarded for rank calculation.
        </dd>
        <dt><xref target="RFC6719" sectionFormat="comma" section="3" /> "The Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective Function":</dt>
        <dd>
                Same as MRHOF extended to AP selection.

            All the Common Ancestor AP Selection Policies (<xref target="ca_policies"/>) apply their corresponding criterion to filter the list of candidate neighbors in the Alternative Parent set.
            The AP is then selected from the Alternative Parent set based on Rank and using hysteresis as is done for the PP in MRHOF.
            It is noteworthy that the OF uses the same Objective Code Point (OCP): (TBD1) for all policies used.

            The PS information can be used by any of the described AP selection policies or other ones not described here, depending on requirements.
            It is optional for all nodes to use the same AP selection policies.
            Different nodes may use different AP selection policies since the selection policy is local to each node.
            For example, using different policies can be used to vary the transmission reliability in each hop.

            In order to select their AP node, nodes need to be aware of their grandparent node sets. 
            Within <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref>, the nodes use the DODAG Information Object (DIO) Control Message to broadcast information about themselves to potential children.
            However, <xref target="RFC6550">RPL</xref>, does not define how to propagate information related to the parent set, which is what this document addresses. 
      </t>
      <t>
            DIO messages can carry multiple options, out of which the <xref target="RFC6551">DAG Metric Container option</xref> is the most suitable structurally and semantically to carry the parent set.
            The DAG Metric Container option itself can carry different nested objects, out of which the <xref target="RFC6551">Node State and Attribute (NSA)</xref> is appropriate for transferring generic node state data.
            Within the Node State and Attribute, it is possible to store optional TLVs representing various node characteristics.
            As per the <xref target="RFC6551">Node State and Attribute (NSA)</xref> description, no TLV has been defined for use.
            This document defines one TLV for transmitting a node's parent set.

        Therefore, a way to control whether PRE is applied to a path's packets SHOULD be implemented.

      <name>Implementation Status</name>
      <t>
        A research-stage implementation of the PRE mechanism using the proposed extension as part of a 6TiSCH IOT use case was developed at IMT Atlantique, France by Tomas Lagos Jenschke and Remous-Aris Koutsiamanis.
        It was implemented on the open-source Contiki OS and tested with the Cooja simulator.
        The DIO DAGMC NSA extension is implemented with a configurable number of parents from the parent set of a node to be reported.

                Node S (source) is the only data packet sender and sends data to node R (root).
                The parent set of each node (except R) is all the nodes in the immediately higher row, the immediately above 6 nodes.
                For example, each node in {51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56} is connected to all of {41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46}.
                Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 have a single upwards link to R.

      <name>Choosing an AP selection policy</name>
      <t>
        The manner of choosing an AP selection policy is left to the implementation, for maximum flexibility.
      </t>
      <t>
        For example, a different policy can be used per traffic type.
        The network configurator can choose the CA Relaxed policy to increase reliability (thus producing some flooding) for specific, extremely important, alert packets.
        On the other hand, all normal data traffic uses the CA Strict policy.
        Therefore, an exception is made just for the alert packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        Another option would be to devise a new disjoint policy, where the paths are on purpose non-correlated, to increase path diversity and resilience against whole groups of nodes failing.
        The disadvantage may be increased jitter.
      </t>
      <t>
        Finally, a network configurator may provide the CA policies with a preference order of Strict &gt; Medium &gt; Relaxed as a means of falling back to more flood-prone policies to maintain reliability.
